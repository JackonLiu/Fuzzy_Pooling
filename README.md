# Fuzzy_Pooling
Contains all the files for running multiple pooling operations
NOTES:
1. To change the model, change it in the main file and along with it the datasets also
2. To change the pooling layers, change them in the individual models
3. All the models are written assuming an image size of 32x32, change the transforms/model layers padding to adjust to alternate sizes
